# chat-EXT
A Google Chrome extension that harnesses the power of LLMs to process selected text within a webpage. 

## Features:
The extension enables simple one-click access to a selection of pre-written prompts that perform the following functions.
- [ ] Summarization
- [ ] Paraphrasing

A manual prompting mode will also be available for custom prompts. 

## Disclaimer:
The code was created by prompting ChatGPT to help with generating boilerplate code and understanding the process through which the different components interconnect. I have no prior experience with creating Google Chrome extensions and consider this project to be a programming exercise. This project is not for commercial use.
